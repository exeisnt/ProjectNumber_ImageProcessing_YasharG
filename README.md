Deep Learning Pipeline for Image Classification

Project Overview

This project implements a complete deep learning pipeline to classify images using a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). The pipeline includes dataset preprocessing, model development, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation. Additionally, techniques like regularization and data augmentation are employed to enhance model performance.

Project Setup

1. Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools and libraries are installed:
	•	Python 3.8+
	•	Required Python packages:

pip install tensorflow matplotlib scikit-learn



2. Clone the Repository

Clone the project from GitHub to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/[YourUsername]/ProjectNumber_ImageProcessing_[YourName].git
cd ProjectNumber_ImageProcessing_[YourName]

3. Project Structure

The project directory is organized as follows:

ProjectNumber_ImageProcessing_[YourName]/
├── data/                # Dataset folder
├── code/                # Source code files
│   ├── preprocess.py    # Data preprocessing and augmentation
│   ├── model.py         # CNN model definition
│   ├── train_model.py   # Training script
│   ├── evaluate_model.py # Evaluation script

├── README.md            # Documentation (this file)
└── .gitignore           # Ignore unnecessary files

Steps to Run the Code

1. Preprocessing the Dataset

Run the preprocessing script to prepare the dataset. This includes normalization, splitting into train/validation/test sets, and data augmentation.

python code/preprocess.py

2. Train the CNN Model

Train the model using the preprocessed dataset. This script builds a CNN, applies regularization techniques, and trains it over multiple epochs.

python code/train_model.py

3. Evaluate the Model

Evaluate the trained model on the test dataset to calculate performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) and generate visualizations like confusion matrix and accuracy/loss curves.

python code/evaluate_model.py

Results

1. Model Performance
	•	Training Accuracy: ~85%
	•	Validation Accuracy: ~83%
	•	Test Accuracy: ~82%

2. Evaluation Metrics
	•	Confusion Matrix:
	•	Shows how well the model classifies each category.
	•	Precision, Recall, F1 Score:
	•	Detailed metrics for each class (e.g., airplane, car, etc.).

3. Visualizations
	•	Training/Validation Accuracy Curve:
	•	Tracks the model’s performance during training.
	•	Training/Validation Loss Curve:
	•	Monitors overfitting by comparing training and validation loss.

Key Features
	1.	Data Augmentation: Enhances dataset variability (rotation, scaling, flipping).
	2.	Regularization: Uses dropout, L2 regularization, and early stopping to reduce overfitting.
	3.	Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizes parameters like learning rate, batch size, and architecture.
	4.	Optional Transfer Learning: Fine-tunes pre-trained models (e.g., MobileNet, ResNet) for small datasets.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the implementation of a robust deep learning pipeline for image classification. By leveraging techniques like data augmentation, regularization, and hyperparameter tuning, the model achieves competitive performance. Future improvements can involve exploring advanced architectures or larger datasets.
